This is the API for the Tabata Sprinter Android application (though it can easily work for other applications).

It only responds to POST requests, and takes all its parameters as POST variables. The responses are always JSON objects.

It supports the following methods:

- createUser
-- args: (email, password)
-- return: {success: true}
- checkAuthentication
-- args: (email, password)
-- return: {success: true}
- addHistory
-- args: (email, password, sprintSeconds, restSeconds, numSprints)
-- return: {success: true}
- getHistory
-- args: (email, password)
-- return: {history:[{id,performedAt,sprintSeconds,restSeconds,numSprints,timezone}[,...]]}
